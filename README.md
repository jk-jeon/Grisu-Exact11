# Grisu-Exact11
This is a C++11-compatible implementation of Grisu-Exact (https://github.com/jk-jeon/Grisu-Exact).

To avoid possible name clash, I renamed namespaces and header files by adding `11` at the end. Also, various tests are removed.

The usage of this library is same as that of the original one, except for the above mentioned renamings.
